Animated lights added to a bike bag.

Pro trinket 5V - https://www.adafruit.com/product/2000

3 8-light Neopixel Strips - https://www.adafruit.com/product/1426

2 switch - https://www.adafruit.com/product/1092

2 10k resistor - https://www.adafruit.com/product/2784

3d printed printed part will be used to mount the three neopixel strips. The .stl file for the 3d printed part is included.

check out the .JPG image that will show the wiring.

wiring is pretty simple provide 5V and Ground for the neopixel strips and from Pin-4 to data in 
of Neopixel Strip. 

From 5V to First switch to Pin-9 with a 10k resistor between Pin-9 and Ground.
From 5v to Second switch to Pin-10 with a 10k resistor between Pin-10 and Ground

once the lights are running you can use the first switch to change between the modes that are programmed. 
once the lights are running you can use the second switch to change between the regular (85) brightness and full (255) brightness
